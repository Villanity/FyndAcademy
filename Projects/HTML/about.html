 <h1>Hello Students, Welcome to the Fynd Academy</h1>

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>
    For a company rooted in tech and innovation, skilled professionals are everything, be it engineers, designers, testers or developers. They create and design products, decode problems and go beyond when the situation demands. We know from experience that finding skilled applicants is hard. And even when we hire a new team member, it takes a while before the candidate can meaningfully contribute. To solve this problem, we are introducing Fynd Academy.
    
    We believe we can change how we hire and how the new team members grow in our company. Instead of taking the usual long-winded approach, we intend to equip applicants with skills that one usually acquires on the job. We take our Fynd Academy Trainees through years of tribal knowledge at Fynd, giving them the undiluted, intense and most valuable knowledge that they can put into action right now.</p>
