// The map() method in JavaScript is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results. The syntax for using the map() method is as follows:

array.map(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])

// The callback function takes three arguments:

// element: The current element being processed in the array.
// index (optional): The index of the current element being processed in the array.
// array (optional): The array map() was called upon.
// The thisArg parameter (optional) is the value to be passed as this when executing the callback function.

// Here's an example of using the map() method to square each element in an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

// In this example, the map() method applies the function num => num * num to each element in the numbers array and returns a new array squaredNumbers with the results.
