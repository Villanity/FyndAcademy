// In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to variables defined outside of its own scope, even after the outer function has returned. This is made possible by the fact that functions in JavaScript are first-class objects that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

// Here's an example of a closure in JavaScript:

function outerFunction() {
    var outerVariable = 'Hello';
  
    function innerFunction() {
      console.log(outerVariable + ' World!');
    }
  
    return innerFunction;
  }
  
  var closure = outerFunction();
  closure(); // Output: 'Hello World!'

//   In this example, outerFunction returns innerFunction, which is a closure. When outerFunction is called, it defines a local variable outerVariable and a function innerFunction, which has access to outerVariable. outerFunction then returns innerFunction.

// The variable closure is assigned the returned value of outerFunction, which is innerFunction. When closure is called later on, it has access to outerVariable and prints 'Hello World!' to the console.

// Note that outerVariable is not accessible outside of outerFunction, but innerFunction has access to it because of the closure. This allows for encapsulation and information hiding, which are important principles of software design.

// Sure, here's an example of a counter implemented using a closure:

function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }

  return increment;
}

var myCounter = counter();
myCounter(); // Output: 1
myCounter(); // Output: 2
myCounter(); // Output: 3

// In this example, the counter function returns the increment function, which is a closure. increment has access to the count variable defined in counter, even after counter has returned.

// When myCounter is called, it executes the increment function returned by counter, which increments the count variable and logs its value to the console. Each subsequent call to myCounter increments the count variable and logs its updated value.

// Note that count is not accessible outside of the counter function, but the closure created by increment has access to it. This allows us to create a private variable that can only be accessed and modified through the closure, which helps to prevent unintended changes to the variable from outside code.
